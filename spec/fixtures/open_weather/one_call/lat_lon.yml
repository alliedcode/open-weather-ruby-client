          health\neffects increase as air quality deteriorates.\nFine particulate matter
          - also known as PM-2.5 - is an air\ncontaminant that can aggravate heart and

          with asthma. A\ndecrease in physical activity is recommended.\nThe Maricopa
          County Air Quality Department has issued a No Burn Day.\nFireplace use and
